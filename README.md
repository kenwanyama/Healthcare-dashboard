# Immunization Dashboard: Flu Shots 2022

### THE PROBLEM

Understanding and visualizing the landscape of flu vaccinations is crucial for public health initiatives. This project addresses the need for a comprehensive view of flu shot administration in 2022. The challenge lies in aggregating and presenting synthetically generated healthcare data in a meaningful way.

### SOLUTION

Our solution involves developing a Flu Shots Dashboard for 2022 using synthetically generated healthcare data from the Synthea project. Leveraging SQL queries, we analyzed patient details such as birthdate, race, and county for individuals aged six months or older who received flu shots during the specified period. The culmination of this analysis is a dynamic Tableau dashboard, offering a visually engaging and informative representation of flu shot percentages based on age, race, and county.
